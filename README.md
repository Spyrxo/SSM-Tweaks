## Q&A:

**?** Where can I download this mod?
> If you look on the right-hand side of website, you'll see a button called "Releases". If you click that, navigate to the latest version, and download the file "SSMTweaks.jar", you can drag and drop that into your mods folder.

**?** Why did you create this mod?
> Because after playing this game for 10 years I thought since no one else is going to fix the dumb inconsistencies... "the hardest sacrifices require the strongest wills"

**?** Is this mod only for SSM specific servers? What happens if I use it on another server?
> The mod automatically detects if the server your playing on. If it's an allowed server, the tweaks will run. If it not allowed, then the mod disables, works like regular vanilla minecraft.

**?** Will you update the mod to later versions of MC, perhaps ones that run their own version of SSM?
> No. If those people want that compatibility, they can fork and update the mod themselves. Also Fabric is probably way better for those versions anyways.

**?** I've found a bug/issue OR I want to make a feature request? Where do I go?
> Head over to the "Issues" tab on the top of the repo page, and put your information there. If its a bug, a video or in-depth explanation on how you triggered it would be nice.

**?** I want to see a list of all the fixes & tweaks the mod has to offer?
> You can just go to the "Releases" section of the repo, I try to detail additions and changes in those logs, so you can read them all there.

**?** This mod is great, but I have no idea where I can go to play SSM?
> You can head over to this discord server and play the game for free: https://discord.gg/yPyGdjzSzw
